Written from scratch launcher for my mc server.
Java + Swing.

It's very very very complicated because i didnt want to mess with Mojang EULA.
Launcher is completing all the game files and all the mods on the client's computer.
It's also capable od updating itself, updating gamefiles, etc.

Written in 2021, stopped working on it in 2022 as my server has been closed because of lack of my time.
