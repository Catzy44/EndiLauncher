its a launcher for my mc server
java + Swing
its looking very good for this tech - check it out! maximalism! (RELEASES)

its very very very complicated because i didnt want to mess with Mojang EULA
launcher is completing all the game files and all the mods on the client's computer
its capable od updating itself, updating gamefiles, etc

written in 2021, stopped working on it in 2022 as my server has been closed because of lack of my time
